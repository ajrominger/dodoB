@ARTICLE{Haegeman2017-kf,
  title       = "A general sampling formula for community structure data",
  author      = "Haegeman, Bart and Etienne, Rampal S",
  abstract    = "* The development of neutral community theory has shown that
                 the assumption of species neutrality, although implausible on
                 the level of individual species, can lead to reasonable
                 predictions on the community level. While Hubbell's neutral
                 model and several of its variants have been analysed in quite
                 some detail, the comparison of theoretical predictions with
                 empirical abundance data is often hindered by technical
                 problems. Only for a few models the exact solution of the
                 stationary abundance distribution is known and sufficiently
                 simple to be applied to data. For other models, approximate
                 solutions have been proposed, but their accuracy is
                 questionable. * Here, we argue that many of these technical
                 problems can be overcome by replacing the assumption of
                 constant community size (the zero-sum constraint) by the
                 assumption of independent species abundances. * We present a
                 general sampling formula for community abundance data under
                 this assumption. We show that for the few models for which an
                 exact solution with zero-sum constraint is known, our
                 independent species approach leads to very similar parameter
                 estimates as the zero-sum models, for six frequently studied
                 tropical forest community samples. * We show that our general
                 sampling formula can be easily confronted to a much wider
                 range of datasets (very large datasets, relative abundance
                 data, presence-absence data, and sets of multiple samples) for
                 a large class of models, including non-neutral ones. We
                 provide an R package, called SADISA (Species Abundance
                 Distributions under the Independent Species Assumption), to
                 facilitate the use of the sampling formula.",

              detect genuinely random divergence times across taxa, and suggest
              the cause is Lindley's paradox. Although the predictions are
              similar, we show that their findings are more fundamentally
              explained by insufficient prior sampling that arises with poorly
              chosen wide priors that critically undersample nonsimultaneous

              supports recent divergences without support for synchronous

               dataset was collected (n = 747 individuals) for 12 snake taxon
               pairs. Phylogeographical structure was estimated for each taxon.
               Redundancy analyses were used to assess the importance of
               geographical distance, climate and putative barriers to gene
               flow in structuring genetic diversity. Hierarchical approximate
               Bayesian computation was used to estimate the magnitude of
               synchronicity in divergence times across a well-documented
               phylogeographical barrier. Lastly, gene divergence and
               population divergence times were estimated using multiple
               methods. Results There is substantial phylogeographical
               structure in many of the snake taxa, particularly at the CFB. A
               model containing distance, climate and barriers explained the
               greatest amount of genetic variation in nearly all taxa. When
               each variable was examined separately, climate explained the

              reflecting relatively colder and/or less humid climatic

              covered by salt marshes. Interestingly, drought-susceptible

              input of nutrients transported mainly by the Brazilian Coastal
              Current (BCC) and partly discharged by the Rio Itaja{\'\i} (the
              major river closest to the core site). This was strongly related
              to changes in sea level. A stronger influence of the BCC with
              nutrient rich waters occurred during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 4
              and in particular during the late MIS 3 and MIS 2 under low sea
              level. Evidence of Nothofagus pollen grains from the southern
              Andes during late MIS 3 and MIS 2 suggests an efficient transport
              by the southern westerlies and Argentinean rivers, then by the
              Malvinas Current and finally by the BCC to the study site. Major
              changes in the pollen/spore and dinocyst assemblages occur with
              similar pacing, indicating strongly interlinked continental and
              marine environmental changes. Proxy comparisons suggest that the
              changes were driven by similar overarching factors, of which the

              These effects are significant but complex at the upper margins of
              expanding oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), where deoxygenation and
              biogeochemical feedbacks to low dissolved oxygen (DO) are
              regulated by biological production and consumption of DO via
              gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (CR). We
              used `marine lakes'---bodies of seawater surrounded by land---as
              a natural experimental system for examining the environmental
              factors that dictate coupling and de-coupling between GPP and CR.
              Distinct gradients in DO (from fully oxygenated to anoxic
              conditions), temperature, light, quantity and quality of organic
              matter, presence of key nutrients, and microbial community
              structure occur across multiple stratified meromictic lakes and
              well-mixed holomictic marine lakes present in Palau. We found
              consistently high GPP rates in stratified meromictic lakes (>10
              mmol O2 m-3 d-1)---especially near the chemocline, where
              nutrients diffuse upwards from anoxic waters---and a wider range
              of rates in well-mixed lakes (0.350 to 57.9 mmol O2 m-3 d-1). In
              contrast to GPP, CR rates were typically lower and less variable
              across different depths and lakes. Most depths in most lakes were
              therefore net autotrophic (i.e., net community production [NCP] >
              0). However, experimental additions of ammonium (5 $\mu$M) and
              labile organic carbon (100 $\mu$M) had strong effects on CR,
              resulting in (i) several-fold increases in CR, (ii) larger
              increases in CR in meromictic lakes with chemoclines near the
              surface, and (iii) the occurrence of net heterotrophy and DO
              consumption. Our results are indicative of several biogeochemical
              feedback mechanisms to deoxygenation present at the upper margins
              of shoaling OMZs that are governed by nutrient turnover. In
              marine lakes, these feedbacks can have strong effects on nutrient
              uptake and the production and consumption of oxygen, with

               species turnover along the central region of the Atlantic Forest
               hotspot to (1) test whether local rivers, particularly the Rio
               Doce, are associated with marked biogeographical breaks, and (2)
               investigate how regional compositional changes correlate with
               geo-climatic variables. Location The central region of the
               Atlantic Forest in eastern Brazil (12°--22° S latitude). Methods
               We combine occurrence and geo-climatic data in a generalized
               dissimilarity model, obtaining a continuous prediction of
               species turnover across space and identifying 12 significant
               geo-climatic predictors of community composition. We use a
               two-step cluster analysis to classify the turnover map into
               major floristic regions based on the natural subgroups observed.
               We further divide each major floristic region into smaller
               sub-regions based on natural subgroups statistically identified
               by the two-step cluster analyses. Results High levels of
               turnover in species composition occurred around latitudes
               18°--19° S, c. 50--100 km north of the Rio Doce, and concurred
               with shifts in availability of both humidity and energy. We
               identified three major floristic regions in the central region
               of the Atlantic Forest, which we called Bahia Interior Forests,
               Bahia Coastal Forests, and the Kren{\'a}k-Waitak{\'a} Forests --
               each of them divided into two to four subregions. Main
               conclusions Our results suggest that local climatic conditions,
               not riverine barriers, drive biogeographical shifts in this
               region -- a finding that supports studies of current and
               historical determinants of the composition of the Atlantic
               Forest biota. Floristic composition at higher elevations (> 600
               m) is clearly distinct from those in lower elevations, likely as
               a result of physiological constraints imposed by cooler climates
               in the former. Floristic regions here identified from observed

               study of terrestrial vertebrate species richness for two
               analogous montane areas critical for biodiversity conservation:
               the Greater Yellowstone region of the Rocky Mountains, United
               States, and the Nahuel Huapi region, Patagonia, around
               Bariloche, Argentina. We explored the ecological interactions of
               such factors as latitude, habitat heterogeneity, inferred
               productivity, geographic context, history of lineage, and
               history of environment in generating and maintaining species
               richness. Overall species richness of terrestrial vertebrates
               was higher in the Yellowstone area, but patterns were not
               uniform across vertebrate classes. Ectotherms (reptiles and
               amphibians) were more diverse in the Patagonian site, whereas
               endotherms (birds and mammals) were more diverse in the
               Yellowstone site. The higher diversity of Patagonian ectotherms
               is a result of abnormally high numbers of species within two
               specialized taxa: frogs and the lizard genus Liolaemus. There
               were high percentages of endemic species (68\% of amphibians,
               35\% of reptiles, 15\% of mammals) and feral, non-native mammals
               (19\%) in Patagonia. These results imply that (1) biodiversity
               is generated and maintained by a combination of local phenomena
               and by continental area and related historical constraints; (2)
               the relative weight of the various influences may differ for
               ectotherms ( fit latitudinal and related models) and endotherms
               ( fit history-based models); and (3) because larger-scale
               processes are so important for the maintenance of natural
               biological diversity, it is crucial that biological reserves be
               selected and managed with an understanding of the geographical
               and geological context of the continents on which they are

               such as migrants that require large areas for maintenance of

               analysis of arthropod communities. In contrast, variation of DNA
               degradation rates is a largely neglected source of bias.
               Differential degradation of DNA molecules could cause
               underrepresentation of taxa in a community sequencing sample.
               Arthropods are often collected by passive sampling devices, like
               malaise traps. Specimens in such a trap are exposed to varying
               periods of suboptimal storage and possibly different rates of
               DNA degradation. Degradation bias could thus be a significant
               issue, skewing diversity estimates. Here, we estimate the effect
               of differential DNA degradation on the recovery of community
               diversity of Hawaiian arthropods and their associated
               microbiota. We use a simple DNA size selection protocol to test
               for degradation bias in mock communities, as well as passively
               collected samples from actual Malaise traps. We compare the
               effect of DNA degradation to that of varying PCR conditions,
               including primer choice, annealing temperature and cycle number.
               Our results show that DNA degradation does indeed bias community

              ?-diversity, changes in community composition between sites, are
              largely unknown, especially in the tropics. Using a 10-year data
              set on Costa Rican birds, we find that low-intensity agriculture
              sustained ?-diversity across large scales on a par with forest.
              In high-intensity agriculture, low local (?) diversity inflated
              ?-diversity as a statistical artefact. Therefore, at small
              spatial scales, intensive agriculture appeared to retain
              ?-diversity. Unlike in forest or low-intensity systems, however,
              high-intensity agriculture also homogenised vegetation structure
              over large distances, thereby decoupling the fundamental
              ecological pattern of bird communities changing with geographical
              distance. This ~40\% decline in species turnover indicates a
              significant decline in ?-diversity at large spatial scales. These

              serious methodological challenges. First, there has been a long
              debate on how to quantify biodiversity, and second, measurements
              of biodiversity change are scale-dependent. Therefore comparisons
              of biodiversity metrics between communities are ideally carried
              out across scales. Simulation can be used to study the utility of
              biodiversity metrics across scales, but most approaches are
              system specific and plagued by large parameter spaces and
              therefore cumbersome to use and interpret. However, realistic
              spatial biodiversity patterns can be generated without reference
              to ecological processes, which suggests a simple simulation
              framework could provide an important tool for ecologists. Here,
              we present the R package mobsim that allows users to simulate the
              abundances and the spatial distribution of individuals of
              different species. Users can define key properties of
              communities, including the total numbers of individuals and
              species, the relative abundance distribution, and the degree of
              spatial aggregation. Furthermore, the package provides functions
              that derive biodiversity patterns from simulated communities, or
              from observed data, as well as functions that simulate different
              sampling designs. We show several example applications of the
              package. First, we illustrate how species rarefaction and
              accumulation curves can be used to disentangle changes in the
              fundamental biodiversity components: (i) total abundance, (ii)
              relative abundance distribution, (iii) and species aggregation.
              Second, we demonstrate how mobsim can be used to assess the
              performance of species-richness estimators. The latter indicates
              how spatial aggregation challenges classical non-spatial
              species-richness estimators. mobsim allows the simulation and
              analysis of a large range of biodiversity scenarios and sampling
              designs in an efficient and comprehensive way. The simplicity and
              control provided by the package can also make it a useful
              didactic tool. The combination of controlled simulations and
              their analysis will facilitate a more rigorous interpretation of
              real world data that exhibit sampling effects and
              scale-dependence.",

              that the pollen rain accurately reflects the following three main
              forest types: i) a dense ombrophilous forest (or tropical moist
              broadleaf forest) characterized by Myrtaceae associated with high
              percentages of Miconia, Guapira, Ilex, Moraceae-Urticaceae undif.
              or Byrsonima, ii) a seasonal semi-deciduous montane forest
              characterized by an increase of Arecaceae associated with
              Fabaceae-Mimosideae, Myrtaceae, Piper, Cecropia, Urera and
              Mitracarpus, and iii) a seasonal deciduous forest dominated by
              Fabaceae-Mimosideae and Arecaceae tree taxa associated with
              Alternanthera, Cyperaceae and Mitracarpus. Using of botanical
              data from several plots of ombrophilous forest, in which several
              surface soil samples have been collected, allows to roughly
              estimate the over- and underrepresentation of pollen taxa

              several environmental parameters. The precipitation increase with

                efficiently learnable in high dimension. More precisely, we
                prove that a mixture with known identical covariance matrices
                whose number of components is a polynomial of any fixed degree
                in the dimension n is polynomially learnable as long as a
                certain non-degeneracy condition on the means is satisfied. It
                turns out that this condition is generic in the sense of
                smoothed complexity, as soon as the dimensionality of the space
                is high enough. Moreover, we prove that no such condition can
                possibly exist in low dimension and the problem of learning the
                parameters is generically hard. In contrast, much of the
                existing work on Gaussian Mixtures relies on low-dimensional
                projections and thus hits an artificial barrier. Our main
                result on mixture recovery relies on a new
                ``Poissonization``-based technique, which transforms a mixture
                of Gaussians to a linear map of a product distribution. The
                problem of learning this map can be efficiently solved using
                some recent results on tensor decompositions and Independent
                Component Analysis (ICA), thus giving an algorithm for
                recovering the mixture. In addition, we combine our
                low-dimensional hardness results for Gaussian mixtures with
                Poissonization to show how to embed difficult instances of
                low-dimensional Gaussian mixtures into the ICA setting, thus
                establishing exponential information-theoretic lower bounds for
                underdetermined ICA in low dimension. To the best of our
                knowledge, this is the first such result in the literature. In
                addition to contributing to the problem of Gaussian mixture
                learning, we believe that this work is among the first steps
                toward better understanding the rare phenomenon of the
                ``blessing of dimensionality'' in the computational aspects of

                 taxonomic classifications for taxa never incorporated into a
                 phylogeny. We present a draft tree containing 2.3 million
                 tips-the Open Tree of Life. Realization of this tree required
                 the assembly of two additional community resources: (i) a
                 comprehensive global reference taxonomy and (ii) a database of

                 crypsis, particularly in open marine systems that may rapidly
                 dissipate signals of evolutionary processes. These
                 complications may be alleviated by studying systems with
                 simpler histories and clearer boundaries, such as marine
                 lakes-small bodies of seawater entirely surrounded by land. As
                 an example, we consider the jellyfish Mastigias spp. which
                 occurs in two ecotypes, one in marine lakes and one in coastal
                 oceanic habitats, throughout the Indo-West Pacific (IWP). We
                 tested three evolutionary hypotheses to explain the current
                 distribution of the ecotypes: (H1) the ecotypes originated
                 from an ancient divergence; (H2) the lake ecotype was derived
                 recently from the ocean ecotype during a single divergence
                 event; and (H3) the lake ecotype was derived from multiple,
                 recent, independent, divergences. We collected specimens from
                 21 locations throughout the IWP, reconstructed multilocus
                 phylogenetic and intraspecific relationships, and measured
                 variation in up to 40 morphological characters. The species
                 tree reveals three reciprocally monophyletic regional clades,
                 two of which contain ocean and lake ecotypes, suggesting
                 repeated, independent evolution of coastal ancestors into
                 marine lake ecotypes, consistent with H3; hypothesis testing
                 and an intraspecific haplotype network analysis of samples
                 from Palau reaffirms this result. Phylogenetic character
                 mapping strongly correlates morphology to environment rather
                 than lineage (r=0.7512, p<0.00001). Considering also the
                 deeper relationships among regional clades, morphological
                 similarity in Mastigias spp. clearly results from three
                 separate patterns of evolution: morphological stasis in ocean
                 medusae, convergence of lake morphology across distinct
                 species and parallelism between lake morphologies within
                 species. That three evolutionary routes each result in crypsis
                 illustrates the challenges of interpreting evolutionary
                 processes from patterns of biogeography and diversity in the
                 seas. Identifying cryptic species is only the first step in
                 understanding these processes; an equally important second

               smaller islands. Ecological theories, the most influential being
               the equilibrium theory of island biogeography1, explain the
               species--area relationship as the outcome of the effect of area
               on immigration and extinction rates. However, these theories do
               not apply to taxa on land masses, including continents and large
               islands, that generate most of their species in situ. In this
               case, species--area relationships should be driven by higher
               speciation rates in larger areas2,3,4,5,6, a theory that has
               never been quantitatively tested. Here we show that Anolis
               lizards on Caribbean islands meet several expectations of the
               evolutionary theory. Within-island speciation exceeds
               immigration as a source of new species on all islands larger
               than 3,000 km2, whereas speciation is rare on smaller islands.
               Above this threshold island size, the rate of species
               proliferation increases with island area, a process that results
               principally from the positive effects of area on speciation
               rate. Also as expected, the slope of the species--area
               relationship jumps sharply above the threshold. Although Anolis
               lizards have been present on large Caribbean islands for over 30
               million years, there are indications that the current number of

               temporal domains. Biotic-interaction datasets are effectively
               siloed, inhibiting cross-dataset comparisons. In order to pool
               resources and bring to light individual datasets, specialized
               research tools are needed to aggregate, normalize, and integrate
               existing datasets with standard taxonomies, ontologies,
               vocabularies, and structured data repositories. Global Biotic
               Interactions (GloBI) provides such tools by way of an open,
               community-driven infrastructure designed to lower the barrier
               for researchers to perform ecological systems analysis and
               modeling. GloBI provides a tool that (a) ingests, normalizes,
               and aggregates datasets, (b) integrates interoperable data with
               accepted ontologies (e.g., OBO Relations Ontology, Uberon, and
               Environment Ontology), vocabularies (e.g., Coastal and Marine
               Ecological Classification Standard), and taxonomies (e.g.,
               Integrated Taxonomic Information System and National Center for
               Biotechnology Information Taxonomy Database), (c) makes data
               accessible through an application programming interface (API)
               and various data archives (Darwin Core, Turtle, and Neo4j), and
               (d) houses a data collection of about 700,000 species
               interactions across about 50,000 taxa, covering over 1100
               references from 19 data sources. GloBI has taken an open-source
               and open-data approach in order to make integrated
               species-interaction data maximally accessible and to encourage
               users to provide feedback, contribute data, and improve data
               access methods. The GloBI collection of datasets is currently
               used in the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and Gulf of Mexico

                 diversification but lacks evidence of an associated reduction
                 in gene flow. This paper describes a study in which molecular
                 markers were used to examine the effects of allopatric
                 divergence and habitat on levels of gene flow in the Caribbean
                 lizard, Anolis roquet. Three study transects were constructed
                 to compare variation in microsatellite allele frequencies and
                 morphology across phylogenetic and habitat boundaries in
                 northern Martinique. Results showed reductions in gene flow to
                 be concordant with divergent selection for habitat type. No
                 evidence could be found for divergence in allopatry

                 can promote dispersal and vicariance, thereby influencing
                 large-scale biogeographic patterns and ecological processes.
                 An example is that of transient corridors of suitable habitat
                 across disjunct but ecologically similar regions, which have
                 been associated with climate change over time. Such
                 connections likely played a role in the assembly of tropical
                 communities, especially within the highly diverse Amazonian
                 and Atlantic rainforests of South America. Although these
                 forests are presently separated by open and dry ecosystems,
                 paleoclimatic and phylogenetic evidence suggest that they have
                 been transiently connected in the past. However, little is
                 known about the timing, magnitude and the distribution of
                 former forest connections. We employ sequence data at multiple
                 loci from three codistributed arboreal lizards (Anolis
                 punctatus, Anolis ortonii and Polychrus marmoratus) to infer
                 the phylogenetic relationships among Amazonian and Atlantic
                 Forest populations and to test alternative historical
                 demographic scenarios of colonization and vicariance using
                 coalescent simulations and approximate Bayesian computation
                 (ABC). Data from the better-sampled Anolis species support
                 colonization of the Atlantic Forest from eastern Amazonia.
                 Hierarchical ABC indicates that the three species colonized
                 the Atlantic Forest synchronously during the mid-Pleistocene.
                 We find support of population bottlenecks associated with
                 founder events in the two Anolis, but not in P. marmoratus,
                 consistently with their distinct ecological tolerances. Our
                 findings support that climatic fluctuations provided key
                 opportunities for dispersal and forest colonization in eastern
                 South America through the cessation of environmental barriers.
                 Evidence of species-specific histories strengthens assertions

  abstract    = "Since the recognition that allopatric speciation can be
                 induced by large-scale reconfigurations of the landscape that
                 isolate formerly continuous populations, such as the
                 separation of continents by plate tectonics, the uplift of
                 mountains or the formation of large rivers, landscape change
                 has been viewed as a primary driver of biological
                 diversification. This process is referred to in biogeography
                 as vicariance. In the most species-rich region of the world,
                 the Neotropics, the sundering of populations associated with
                 the Andean uplift is ascribed this principal role in
                 speciation. An alternative model posits that rather than being
                 directly linked to landscape change, allopatric speciation is
                 initiated to a greater extent by dispersal events, with the
                 principal drivers of speciation being organism-specific
                 abilities to persist and disperse in the landscape. Landscape
                 change is not a necessity for speciation in this model. Here
                 we show that spatial and temporal patterns of genetic
                 differentiation in Neotropical birds are highly discordant
                 across lineages and are not reconcilable with a model linking
                 speciation solely to landscape change. Instead, the strongest
                 predictors of speciation are the amount of time a lineage has

              throughout the species range. Using cytochrome-b gene (cyt-b)

              size are mainly explained by non-random factors related to
              primary productivity and precipitation, whereas spatial shifts in
              shape correlate with mitochondrial divergence. Cytochrome-b data
              revealed a phylogeographic break around the Jequitinhonha River,

              Differences in palaeostability between regions, and the

                 efforts to digitize the world's biodiversity data, but
                 integrating data from many different providers, and across
                 research domains, remains challenging. Semantic Web
                 technologies have been widely recognized by biodiversity
                 scientists for their potential to help solve this problem, yet
                 these technologies have so far seen little use for
                 biodiversity data. Such slow uptake has been due, in part, to
                 the relative complexity of Semantic Web technologies along
                 with a lack of domain-specific software tools to help
                 non-experts publish their data to the Semantic Web. RESULTS:
                 The BiSciCol Triplifier is new software that greatly
                 simplifies the process of converting biodiversity data in
                 standard, tabular formats, such as Darwin Core-Archives, into
                 Semantic Web-ready Resource Description Framework (RDF)
                 representations. The Triplifier uses a vocabulary based on the
                 popular Darwin Core standard, includes both Web-based and
                 command-line interfaces, and is fully open-source software.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Unlike most other RDF conversion tools, the
                 Triplifier does not require detailed familiarity with core
                 Semantic Web technologies, and it is tailored to a widely
                 popular biodiversity data format and vocabulary standard. As a
                 result, the Triplifier can often fully automate the conversion
                 of biodiversity data to RDF, thereby making the Semantic Web
                 much more accessible to biodiversity scientists who might
                 otherwise have relatively little knowledge of Semantic Web
                 technologies. Easy availability of biodiversity data as RDF
                 will allow researchers to combine data from disparate sources
                 and analyze them with powerful linked data querying tools.
                 However, before software like the Triplifier, and Semantic Web
                 technologies in general, can reach their full potential for
                 biodiversity science, the biodiversity informatics community
                 must address several critical challenges, such as the

               climate change is a central goal of comparative phylogeography
               and comparative population genomics, and an endeavor that has
               increasing potential to integrate with community ecology. New
               sequencing technology now provides the potential to gain complex
               demographic inference at unprecedented resolution across
               assemblages of non-model species. To this end, we introduce the
               aggregate site frequency spectrum (aSFS), an expansion of the
               site frequency spectrum to use single nucleotide polymorphism
               (SNP) datasets collected from multiple, co-distributed species
               for assemblage-level demographic inference. We describe how the
               aSFS is constructed over an arbitrary number of independent
               population samples and then demonstrate how the aSFS can
               differentiate various multi-species demographic histories under
               a wide range of sampling configurations while allowing effective
               population sizes and expansion magnitudes to vary independently.
               We subsequently couple the aSFS with a hierarchical approximate
               Bayesian computation (hABC) framework to estimate degree of
               temporal synchronicity in expansion times across taxa, including
               an empirical demonstration with a dataset consisting of five
               populations of the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus
               aculeatus). Corroborating what is generally understood about the
               recent post-glacial origins of these populations, the joint
               aSFS/hABC analysis strongly suggests that the stickleback data
               are most consistent with synchronous expansion after the Last
               Glacial Maximum (posterior probability = 0.99). The aSFS will
               have general application for multi-level statistical frameworks
               to test models involving assemblages and/or communities and as
               large-scale SNP data from non-model species become routine, the
               aSFS expands the potential for powerful next-generation
               comparative population genomic inference. This article is

              biogeographical history. Location New World and Eurasia. Time
              period Oligocene--Present. Major taxa studied New World
              swallowtail butterfly clade (Papilio: Agehana, Alexanoria,
              Chilasa, Heraclides and Pterourus). Methods We integrated data
              from the most complete current phylogeny of this clade with
              geographical distributions of each species inferred from
              ecological niche models (ENMs). We tested for correlation between
              breadth of available abiotic ecological niche space, latitude and
              differential rates of diversification between tropical and
              non-tropical lineages. The clade's history of climatic and
              geographical occupancy was also reconstructed using both
              continuous ancestral character reconstructions and
              biogeographical history inferred under a
              dispersal--extinction--cladogenesis model. We considered both
              latitudinal and climatic definitions of tropicality in our
              reconstructions. Results There was no strong support for
              ecological opportunity or macroevolutionary processes as
              latitudinal diversity gradient drivers. Instead, we recovered
              discordant patterns in phylogenetic reconstructions of
              latitudinal geographical range and suitable abiotic climate
              conditions. Heraclides are likely to have originated and
              diversified in climatically and latitudinally tropical
              environments before some lineages dispersed to temperate
              habitats. The Alexanoria + Chilasa + Pterourus clade is likely to
              have originated in climatically and latitudinally temperate
              habitat before dispersing and diversifying; some lineages are
              likely to have dispersed into the latitudinal tropics via
              highland temperate-analogue environments. Main conclusions The
              LDG in New World swallowtails results from complex interactions
              between ecological niche evolution and biogeographical history;
              both out-of-the-tropics and into-the-tropics processes have
              contributed to the LDG. Our results present an example where
              temperate zones appear to be a source, instead of a sink, for
              biodiversity. Our results emphasize the need to consider
              biogeographical history not only from the perspective of shifts
              in geographical space, but also in terms of constraints enforced

               this cataclysmic event that unfolded at the end of the
               Permian.After setting the scene, Erwin introduces the suite of
               possible perpetrators and the types of evidence paleontologists
               seek. He then unveils the actual evidence--moving from China,
               where much of the best evidence is found; to a look at
               extinction in the oceans; to the extraordinary fossil animals of
               the Karoo Desert of South Africa. Erwin reviews the evidence for
               each of the hypotheses before presenting his own view of what
               happened.Although full recovery took tens of millions of years,
               this most massive of mass extinctions was a powerful creative
               force, setting the stage for the development of the world as we
               know it today.In a new preface, Douglas Erwin assesses
               developments in the field since the book's initial publication.",

                 analyses of species composition. However, it is disputed
                 whether abundance estimates can be derived from metabarcoding
                 due to taxon specific PCR amplification biases. PCR-free
                 approaches have been suggested to mitigate this problem, but
                 come with considerable increases in workload and cost. Here,
                 we analyze multilocus datasets of diverse arthropod
                 communities, to evaluate whether amplification bias can be
                 countered by (1) targeting loci with highly degenerate primers
                 or conserved priming sites, (2) increasing PCR template
                 concentration, (3) reducing PCR cycle number or (4) avoiding
                 locus specific amplification by directly sequencing genomic
                 DNA. Amplification bias is reduced considerably by degenerate
                 primers or targeting amplicons with conserved priming sites.
                 Surprisingly, a reduction of PCR cycles did not have a strong
                 effect on amplification bias. The association of taxon
                 abundance and read count was actually less predictable with
                 fewer cycles. Even a complete exclusion of locus specific
                 amplification did not exclude bias. Copy number variation of
                 the target loci may be another explanation for read abundance
                 differences between taxa, which would affect amplicon based
                 and PCR free methods alike. As read abundance biases are taxon
                 specific and predictable, the application of correction
                 factors allows abundance estimates.",

              limited by a lack of systematic analyses of low-oxygen
              ecosystems. Marine lakes provide an ideal comparative system, as
              they range from well-mixed holomictic lakes to stratified,
              anoxic, meromictic lakes that vary in their vertical extent of
              anoxia. We examined microbial communities inhabiting six marine
              lakes and one ocean site using pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes.
              Microbial richness and evenness was typically highest in the
              anoxic monimolimnion of meromictic lakes, with common marine
              bacteria present in mixolimnion communities replaced by
              anoxygenic phototrophs, sulfate-reducing bacteria and SAR406 in

              were linked to environmental gradients (constrained variation in
              redundancy analysis = 68\%--76\%) -- particularly oxygen and pH.
              However, in those lakes with the steepest oxygen gradients,
              salinity and dissolved nutrients were important secondary
              constraining variables, indicating that subtle but substantive

               PostgreSQL is the most comprehensive, in-depth, and easy-to-read
               guide to this award-winning database. This book starts with a
               thorough overview of SQL, a description of all PostgreSQL data
               types, and a complete explanation of PostgreSQL commands. If you
               are a developer or an administrator, you'll love the chapter
               that explores PostgreSQL performance. The authors explain how
               PostgreSQL stores data on disk (and in memory) and how to
               measure and influence the effectiveness of PostgreSQL's caching
               mechanisms. You'll also learn how PostgreSQL generates and
               evaluates execution plans. The authors explain all of the query
               operators that can appear in the results of an EXPLAIN command,
               describing the performance implications of each operator as well
               as the conditions which will cause PostgreSQL to use that
               operator.PostgreSQL is also a complete guide for the developer.
               Whether you're developing with C, C++, ODBC, Embedded SQL, Java,
               Tcl/Tk, Perl, Python or PHP, you'll find a comprehensive
               description of the PostgreSQL API for your language of choice.
               Easy to follow exercises will walk you through the development
               of working applications that fully demonstrate the features
               offered by each API. You will also find a chapter that describes
               the PL/pgSQL server-side procedural language, learning how to
               build triggers, functions, and stored-procedures. The authors
               have even included a chapter that walks you through the process
               of extending the PostgreSQL server with custom-written C
               functions and new data types. The accompanying web site,

              time, yet, within large communities of species, aggregated
              patterns of biodiversity seem to display nearly universal

              prospects are independent of its species identity. They have
              successfully predicted certain static, time-independent patterns.
              But they have generally failed to predict temporal patterns, such
              as species ages or population dynamics. We construct a new,

                 recently evolved lineages is spatially restricted, reflects
                 fundamental evolutionary processes such as cryptic divergence,
                 adaptation and biological responses to environmental
                 heterogeneity. Attempts to explain the extraordinary diversity
                 of the tropics, which often includes deep phylogeographic
                 structure, frequently invoke interactions of climate
                 variability across space, time and topography. To evaluate
                 historical versus contemporary drivers of phylogeographic
                 endemism in a tropical system, we analyse the effects of
                 current and past climatic variation on the genetic diversity
                 of 25 vertebrates in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. We
                 identify two divergent bioclimatic domains within the forest
                 and high turnover around the Rio Doce. Independent modelling
                 of these domains demonstrates that endemism patterns are
                 subject to different climatic drivers. Past climate dynamics,
                 specifically areas of relative stability, predict
                 phylogeographic endemism in the north. Conversely,
                 contemporary climatic heterogeneity better explains endemism
                 in the south. These results accord with recent speleothem and
                 fossil pollen studies, suggesting that climatic variability
                 through the last 250 kyr impacted the northern and the
                 southern forests differently. Incorporating sub-regional
                 differences in climate dynamics will enhance our ability to
                 understand those processes shaping high phylogeographic and

              tackled by likelihood-free methods, these approaches typically
              rely on hand-crafted summary statistics of the data. In complex
              settings, designing and selecting suitable summary statistics is
              problematic and results are very sensitive to such choices. In
              this paper, we learn the first exchangeable feature

              genotype data. This is achieved by means of a novel Bayesian

                 Theoretical models of biogeography can be tested by comparing
                 their predictions of quantities such as species ages against
                 empirical estimates. It has previously been claimed that the
                 neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography predicts
                 species ages that are unrealistically long. Any improved
                 theory of biodiversity must rectify this problem, but first it
                 is necessary to quantify the problem precisely. Here we
                 provide analytical expressions for species ages in neutral
                 biodiversity communities. We analyse a spatially implicit
                 metacommunity model and solve for both the zero-sum and
                 non-zero-sum cases. We explain why our new expressions are, in
                 the context of biodiversity, usually more appropriate than
                 those previously imported from neutral molecular evolution.
                 Because of the time symmetry of the spatially implicit neutral
                 model, our expressions also lead directly to formulas for
                 species persistence times and species lifetimes. We use our
                 new expressions to estimate species ages of forest trees under
                 a neutral model and find that they are about an order of
                 magnitude shorter than those predicted previously but still
                 unrealistically long. In light of our results, we discuss

               arachnologists for decades and used to study many unique aspects
               of arachnid biology including genomics, phylogenetics,
               population genetics, and biogeography. These tools have evolved
               over time and now provide myriad methods for exploring
               evolutionary questions. Early tools, while still useful under
               the proper circumstances, are giving way to a new generation of
               DNA sequencing technologies. These new platforms yield
               impressive amounts of data at a fraction of the cost of
               traditional techniques. Herein, we discuss the history and
               future of molecular evolutionary arachnology in terms of
               available genetic/genomic tools and their potential
               applications, strengths, weaknesses, and relative costs.
               Next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms are varied in their
               methods and potential uses, making high-throughput sequencing
               studies focusing on a wide array of questions tractable. To
               date, relatively few studies have employed NGS technologies
               using arachnids, but many could benefit from using them. Because
               no model species exist within the class Arachnida, we have a
               limited understanding of arachnid genomics. With the
               ever-advancing nature of sequencing technologies and
               bioinformatics, arachnologists can relatively easily implement
               NGS studies to bridge the gaps in our understanding and open
               avenues for deeper and more powerful experiments. To this end,
               we discuss examples of applications of NGS technologies focusing
               on arachnid taxa. Despite the allure of acquiring massive
               quantities of sequence data, we should recognize the limitations
               of existing NGS technologies and not forsake pre-NGS methods
               when these technologies could adequately address our questions.",

                 speciation. This study is part of an effort to investigate the
                 molecular genetic underpinnings of adaptive radiation in
                 Hawaiian spiders (genus Tetragnatha). This radiation is found
                 throughout the Hawaiian Islands, showing a common pattern of
                 evolutionary progression from older to younger islands.
                 Moreover, the species are characterized by repeated evolution
                 of similar ecomorphs that can be recognized on the basis of
                 color--Green, Maroon, Large Brown, and Small Brown. However, 2
                 species (including T. kauaiensis from Kauai) are polyphenic,
                 changing from 1 ecomorph (Green) to another (Maroon) at a
                 specific developmental period. The current study focuses on
                 the age-associated color change in the early stages of the
                 radiation to determine whether this ancestral flexibility in
                 phenotype may have translated into diversification of more
                 derived taxa. We conducted a comparative analysis of
                 transcriptome data (expressed genes) from the Maroon morph of
                 T. kauaiensis and T. perreirai (Oahu), which exhibits a single
                 fixed ecomorph (Maroon). Over 70 million sequence reads were
                 generated using Illumina sequencing of messenger RNA. Using
                 reciprocal best hit BLAST searches, 9027 orthologous genes
                 were identified, of which 32 showed signatures of positive
                 selection between the 2 taxa and may be involved in the loss
                 of the ancestral developmental polyphenism and associated
                 switch to separate monophenic ecomorphs. These results provide

                 the geographic scale and delineation of ephemeral or
                 persistent populations for many marine fishes is limited. The
                 Lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) can be commonly found in
                 three western Atlantic zoogeographic provinces, though
                 inhabitants of the temperate northern Virginia Province are
                 often considered tropical vagrants that only arrive during
                 warm seasons from the southern provinces and perish as
                 temperatures decline. Although genetics can locate regions of
                 historical population persistence and isolation, previous
                 evidence of Virginia Province persistence is only provisional
                 due to limited genetic sampling (i.e., mitochondrial DNA and
                 five nuclear loci). To test alternative hypotheses of
                 historical persistence versus the ephemerality of a northern
                 Virginia Province population we used a RADseq generated
                 dataset consisting of 11,708 single nucleotide polymorphisms
                 (SNP) sampled from individuals collected from the eastern Gulf

                 analyses all infer three genetically divergent subpopulations,

                 genetically diverged and a historically persistent ancestral

                 in coastal areas during the warm season can be considered
                 ``local'' and supports offshore migration during the colder
                 months. This research demonstrates how a large number of genes
                 sampled across a geographical range can capture the diversity
                 of coalescent histories (across loci) while inferring
                 population history. Moreover, these results clearly

                 is most likely to arise when a species radiation begins on an

               next-generation sequencing approaches (10,000 - 50,000),
               accurate parameter estimates and model selection were possible
               for models with more ancient demographic events, even given
               relatively small numbers of sampled individuals. However, for
               recent events, larger numbers of individuals were required to
               achieve accuracy and precision in parameter estimates similar to
               that seen for models with older divergence or population size
               changes. We quantify i) the uncertainty in model selection,
               using tools from information theory, and ii) the accuracy and
               precision of parameter estimates, using the root mean squared
               error, as a function of the timing of demographic events, sample
               sizes used in the analysis, and complexity of the simulated
               models.ConclusionsHere, we illustrate the utility of the
               genome-wide AFS for estimating demographic history and provide
               recommendations to guide sampling in population genomics studies
               that seek to draw inference from the AFS. Our results indicate
               that larger samples of individuals (and thus larger AFS) provide
               greater power for model selection and parameter estimation for
               more recent demographic events.",

                 the conventional parametric species-neutral approach (based on
                 'effective number of species' or Hill numbers) to take into
                 account species relatedness, and also generalizes the
                 traditional phylogenetic approach (based on 'total
                 phylogenetic length') to incorporate species abundances. The
                 proposed measure quantifies 'the mean effective number of
                 species' over any time interval of interest, or the 'effective
                 number of maximally distinct lineages' over that time
                 interval. The product of the measure and the interval length
                 quantifies the 'branch diversity' of the phylogenetic tree
                 during that interval. The new measures generalize and unify
                 many existing measures and lead to a natural definition of
                 taxonomic diversity as a special case. The replication
                 principle (or doubling property), an important requirement for
                 species-neutral diversity, is generalized to PD. The widely
                 used Rao's quadratic entropy and the phylogenetic entropy do
                 not satisfy this essential property, but a simple
                 transformation converts each to our measures, which do satisfy

                 used to model the evolution of two-state discrete characters

                 quantitative character, called liability, that is unobserved
                 and that determines the discrete character according to
                 whether the liability exceeds a threshold value. A Markov
                 chain Monte Carlo algorithm is used to infer the evolutionary
                 covariances of the liabilities for discrete characters,

               particular value for characterizing biodiversity and its change.
               However, reporting standards allowing these inventories to be
               re-used, compared to one another, and further integrated with
               other sources of biodiversity data are lacking, impeding their
               broadest utility. Here we provide a conceptual informatics
               framework for capturing, in a standardized and general way, core
               information about processes underpinning inventory work. We dub
               this set of terms Humboldt Core, and demonstrate its utility.
               This proposed framework is based on a community input process,
               followed by extensive refinement and testing using published
               inventories. We first develop a typology of inventories and
               inventory processes, distinguishing between single, elementary
               inventories, extended and summary inventories, representing
               increasing levels of sampling event aggregation. We then further
               describe typical reporting content for inventory processes,
               along with their value for inferring absence and use in
               occupancy modeling. Next we provide an overview of the Humboldt
               Core terms for capture of geospatial, temporal, taxonomic, and
               environmental conditions, along with methodological descriptors
               related to the assessment of sampling effort and inventory
               completeness. Finally, we introduce a pilot implementation of
               Humboldt Core for the ingestion and provision of inventory
               process metadata into Map of Life, demonstrating standardized
               mobilization of metadata from several hundred previously

               model-supported assessment of spatial biodiversity and its

               Atlantic forest, stretching along the Brazilian coast. Methods
               We model the spatial range of the forest under three climatic
               scenarios (current climate, 6000 and 21,000 years ago) with
               BIOCLIM and MAXENT. Historically stable areas or refugia are
               identified as the set of grid cells for which forest presence is
               inferred in all models and time projections. To validate
               inferred refugia, we test whether our models are matched by the
               current distribution of the forest and by fossil pollen data. We
               then investigate whether the location of inferred forest refugia
               is consistent with current patterns of species endemism and
               existing phylogeographical data. Results Forest models agree
               with pollen records and predict a large area of historical
               forest stability in the central corridor (Bahia), as well as a
               smaller refuge (Pernambuco) along the Brazilian coast, matching
               current centres of endemism in multiple taxa and mtDNA diversity
               patterns in a subset of the species examined. Less historical
               stability is predicted in coastal areas south of the Doce river,
               which agrees with most phylogeographical studies in that region.
               Yet some widely distributed taxa show high endemism in the

               historical forest refugia in the Atlantic rain forest and
               suggest spatial variation in persistence of forests through the
               Pleistocene, predicting patterns of biodiversity in several
               local taxa. The results point to the need for further studies to

              apart. Yet, in contrast to terrestrial species, marine species
              have attracted little attention in studies of island theory. The
              experimental and conceptual origins of this dichotomy date back
              to the 1970s, although the apposition has softened in the early
              2000s, in part a consequence of phylogeographic analyses and the
              discovery of new marine environments. Here, I explore the
              possible range of island and island-like settings in the marine
              realm and find good evidence, albeit in short supply, for
              integrating marine with terrestrial perspectives during the

              development of many descriptive marine studies to reduce the
              current deficit, (2) design of rigorous comparative studies
              within and across realms, and (3) modification of conceptual

              describing islands in terms of ecological--evolutionary

                 remarkable biodiversity observed in nature is maintained. On
                 the one hand, simple models of interacting competitors cannot
                 produce the stable persistence of very large ecological
                 communities. On the other hand, neutral models, in which
                 species do not interact and diversity is maintained by
                 immigration and speciation, yield unrealistically small
                 fluctuations in population abundance, and a strong positive
                 correlation between a species' abundance and its age, contrary
                 to empirical evidence. Models allowing for the robust
                 persistence of large communities of interacting competitors
                 are lacking. Here we show that very diverse communities could
                 persist thanks to the stabilizing role of higher-order
                 interactions, in which the presence of a species influences
                 the interaction between other species. Although higher-order
                 interactions have been studied for decades, their role in
                 shaping ecological communities is still unclear. The inclusion
                 of higher-order interactions in competitive network models
                 stabilizes dynamics, making species coexistence robust to the
                 perturbation of both population abundance and parameter
                 values. We show that higher-order interactions have strong
                 effects in models of closed ecological communities, as well as
                 of open communities in which new species are constantly
                 introduced. In our framework, higher-order interactions are
                 completely defined by pairwise interactions, facilitating
                 empirical parameterization and validation of our models.",

  abstract = "* Molecular analysis of predator gut content is a popular tool to
              uncover food web structure and has greatly profited from the
              emergence of next-generation sequencing technology. However, the
              molecular recovery of prey spectra comes with many challenges,
              particularly the overabundance of predator DNA in extractions.
              When predator and prey are distantly related, predator-specific
              blocking primers can be used to preferentially amplify prey DNA.
              But this is difficult in the case of arthropods, where prey and
              predator are often closely related. * Here, we present a simple
              and cost-efficient protocol for high-throughput analysis of the
              gut content of predatory arthropods without the need for blocking
              primers. We test several factors for their potential to enrich
              prey DNA from extractions of predators, including size selection
              of DNA, selection of different body parts for extraction, and
              variation in extraction lysis time and PCR fragment length. *
              Using a locally abundant spider species (Hololena adnexa,
              Agelenidae), we show that prey DNA can be significantly enriched
              from predator extracts by selectively removing high molecular
              weight DNA and by extracting from the midgut and hindgut only. A
              comparison of our results with observational data from other
              agelenid spider species indicates a high efficiency of our
              approach. * Our enrichment protocol allows for the parallel
              analysis of several hundred predators in a single MiSeq run,
              reducing the cost per specimen to only a few dollars and
              requiring a simple and minimal work flow. This will enable

                 models population structure as discrete panmictic units
                 connected by migration, many populations exhibit heterogeneous
                 spatial gradients in population connectivity across
                 semi-continuous habitats. The historical dynamics of such
                 spatially structured populations can be captured by a
                 spatially explicit coalescent model recently proposed by
                 Etheridge (2008) and Barton et al. (2010a, 2010b) and whereby
                 allelic lineages are distributed in a two-dimensional spatial
                 continuum and move within this continuum based on extinction
                 and coalescent events. Though theoretically rigorous, this
                 model, which we here refer to as the continuum model, has not
                 yet been implemented for demographic inference. To this end,
                 here we introduce and demonstrate a statistical pipeline that
                 couples the coalescent simulator of Kelleher et al. (2014)
                 that simulates genealogies under the continuum model, with an
                 approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework for parameter
                 estimation of neighborhood size (that is, the number of
                 locally breeding individuals) and dispersal ability (that is,
                 the distance an offspring can travel within a generation).
                 Using empirically informed simulations and simulation-based
                 ABC cross-validation, we first show that neighborhood size can
                 be accurately estimated. We then apply our pipeline to the
                 South African endemic shrub species Berkheya cuneata to use
                 the resulting estimates of dispersal ability and neighborhood
                 size to infer the average population density of the species.
                 More generally, we show that spatially explicit coalescent
                 models can be successfully integrated into model-based
                 demographic inference.",

               ecological drift and dispersal limitation on the other. This
               book moves beyond these artificial categorizations, showing how
               environmental sorting, dispersal, ecological drift, and other
               processes influence metacommunity structure
               simultaneously.Mathew Leibold and Jonathan Chase argue that the
               relative importance of these processes depends on the
               characteristics of the organisms, the strengths and types of
               their interactions, the degree of habitat heterogeneity, the
               rates of dispersal, and the scale at which the system is
               observed. Using this synthetic perspective, they explore
               metacommunity patterns in time and space, including patterns of
               coexistence, distribution, and diversity. Leibold and Chase
               demonstrate how these processes and patterns are altered by
               micro- and macroevolution, traits and phylogenetic
               relationships, and food web interactions. They then use this
               scale-explicit perspective to illustrate how metacommunity
               processes are essential for understanding macroecological and
               biogeographical patterns as well as ecosystem-level
               processes.Moving seamlessly across scales and subdisciplines,
               Metacommunity Ecology is an invaluable reference, one that
               offers a more integrated approach to ecological patterns and
               processes.",

                 in his 2001 monograph has received much criticism for its
                 unrealistic simplifying assumptions. These are the assumptions
                 of functional equivalence among different species
                 (neutrality), the assumption of point mutation speciation, and
                 the assumption that resources are continuously saturated, such
                 that constant resource availability implies constant community
                 size (zero-sum assumption). Here we focus on the zero-sum
                 assumption. We present a general theory for calculating the
                 probability of observing a particular species-abundance
                 distribution (sampling formula) and show that zero-sum and
                 non-zero-sum formulations of neutral theory have exactly the
                 same sampling formula when the community is in equilibrium.
                 Moreover, for the non-zero-sum community the sampling formula
                 has this same form, even out of equilibrium. Therefore, the
                 term ``zero-sum multinomial (ZSM)'' to describe species
                 abundance patterns, as coined by Hubbell [2001. The Unified

                 University Press, Princeton, NJ], is not really appropriate,
                 as it also applies to non-zero-sum communities. Instead we
                 propose the term ``dispersal-limited multinomial (DLM)'', thus
                 making explicit one of the most important contributions of
                 neutral community theory, the emphasis on dispersal limitation
                 as a dominant factor in determining species abundances.",

              tremendously over recent years, although in two separate
              directions -- ecological, to determine change over space at a
              given time, and evolutionary, to understand change over time.
              Integration of these approaches has remained elusive.
              Archipelagoes with a known geological chronology provide an
              opportunity to study ecological interactions over evolutionary
              time. Here, I focus on the Hawaiian archipelago and summarize the
              development of ecological and evolutionary research; I emphasize
              spiders because they have attributes allowing analysis of
              ecological affinities in concert with diversification. Within
              this framework, I highlight recent insights from the island
              chronosequence, in particular the importance of (i) selection and
              genetic drift in generating diversity; (ii) fusion and fission in
              fostering diversification; and (iii) variability upon which
              selection can act. Insights into biodiversity dynamics at the
              nexus of ecology and evolution are now achievable by integrating
              new tools, in particular (i) ecological metrics (interaction
              networks, maximum entropy inference) across the chronosequence to
              uncover community dynamics and (ii) genomic tools to understand
              contemporaneous microevolutionary change. The work can inform

                 before the time of the dinosaurs, yet how and why this
                 gradient arose remains unresolved. Here we review two major
                 hypotheses for the origin of the latitudinal diversity
                 gradient. The time and area hypothesis holds that tropical
                 climates are older and historically larger, allowing more
                 opportunity for diversification. This hypothesis is supported
                 by observations that temperate taxa are often younger than,
                 and nested within, tropical taxa, and that diversity is
                 positively correlated with the age and area of geographical
                 regions. The diversification rate hypothesis holds that
                 tropical regions diversify faster due to higher rates of
                 speciation (caused by increased opportunities for the
                 evolution of reproductive isolation, or faster molecular
                 evolution, or the increased importance of biotic
                 interactions), or due to lower extinction rates. There is
                 phylogenetic evidence for higher rates of diversification in
                 tropical clades, and palaeontological data demonstrate higher
                 rates of origination for tropical taxa, but mixed evidence for
                 latitudinal differences in extinction rates. Studies of
                 latitudinal variation in incipient speciation also suggest
                 faster speciation in the tropics. Distinguishing the roles of
                 history, speciation and extinction in the origin of the

                 Previous numerical simulations have suggested that complex
                 niche-structured models produce species abundance
                 distributions (SADs) that are qualitatively similar to those
                 of very simple neutral models that ignore differences between
                 species. However, in the absence of an analytical treatment of
                 niche models, one cannot tell whether the two classes of model
                 produce the same patterns via similar or different mechanisms.
                 We present an analytical proof that, in the limit as diversity
                 becomes large, a strong niche model give rises to exactly the
                 same asymptotic form of SAD as the neutral model, and we
                 verify the analytical predictions for a Panamanian tropical

                 high-diversity ecological communities, even when strong niche
                 structure exists. However, neutral theory cannot explain what
                 generates high diversity in the first place, and it may not be
                 valid in low-diversity communities. Our results also confirm
