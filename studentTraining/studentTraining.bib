                 key recommendations regarding next steps in the effort to
                 mobilize the biology community. It is, in essence, a call for
                 national service. A publication discussing these
                 recommendations and action items in more depth will be
                 available later this year. Meanwhile, we highly recommend
                 reading the Executive Summary of V\&C, the NAS report (NAS,
                 2010), and a seminal article by Labov et al. (2010)
                 summarizing the synergy created by these several reports on
                 the changing nature of studies in biology and concomitant need
                 to change biology education. Then, take action! Our hope is to
                 see the formation of a community of biologists, similar to
                 that forming in geology (Manduca et al., 2010): one that will
                 advance biology undergraduate education so it truly reflects
                 the discipline it serves.",
